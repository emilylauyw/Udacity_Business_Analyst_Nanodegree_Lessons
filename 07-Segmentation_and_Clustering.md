# 07 - Segmentation and Clustering

## Segmentation Fundamentals

### Standardization
- Treat all of the objects in the same way
- cheapest and most efficient approach

### Localization
- Allows you to customize based on specifics of the individual.

### Clustering
- A mathematical procedure for multidimensional analysis. Given the characteristics of a set of objects, this procedure groups similar objects into clusters.
- Clustering algorithms try to create segments so that the objects within each segment are as similar or close to each other as possible.

#### Distance
- A way to quantify or measure similarity

#### Learning models
- Supervised: modeling process learns from the target (e.g. various predictive methods such as linear or logistic regression with predictor variables and target variable).
- Unsupervised: No target variable that is used in creating the model. (e.g. clustering)

- Clustering
Learn from multiple variables supplied in the data. It then groups the objects without being told the logic by which to do it. After this process, it ends up creating a new variable known as the cluster number.
