# 07 - Segmentation and Clustering

## Segmentation Fundamentals

### Standardization
- Treat all of the objects in the same way
- cheapest and most efficient approach

### Localization
- Allows you to customize based on specifics of the individual.

### Clustering
- A mathematical procedure for multidimensional analysis. Given the characteristics of a set of objects, this procedure groups similar objects into clusters.
- Clustering algorithms try to create segments so that the objects within each segment are as similar or close to each other as possible.

#### Distance
- A way to quantify or measure similarity
