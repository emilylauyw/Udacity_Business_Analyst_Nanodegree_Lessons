# 04 - Classification Models

## Classification Problems
- New class of predictive models: classification models
- These models help identify what group a data point belong to. Example, if we were to decide whether a person qualifies for a loan or not, we need to look at the person's loan application and classify whether the person should be in the approve loan group or the not approve loan group.

### Classification Models Types:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Boosted Models

### 1. What does classification mean?

### Classification Problems Types

1. Business problems
- Email as spam or inbox?
- Customer going to renew contract or not?

2. Scientific problems
- What land cover type is a pixel from a Satellite image?
- Does soy bean have a disease or not?

3. Real life problems
- What color shirt looks best on me?
- What type of transportation will employee use to go to work?

#### Classification grouping
1. Binary: equal 2 groups
- One that has a yes or no, a 1 or a 0 or a true or false type of value associated with it.

2. Non-binary: more than 2 groups
- the ones that are categorical meaning there are values that take on names, or labels such as red, green, blue, or small, medium and large.

## Binary Classification Problems

### Building out binary classification models
1. Logistic Regression
- Most basic forms of regression modeling
- Formula is very similar to that of a linear regression

### Logistic regression algorithms
- Logit transformation equation
  - Focus on concepts
  - How to apply them
  - How to interpret results

- Probit transformation equation
- Log-Log transformation

### Stepwise regression
- Way to automatically identify which variables are most important to the model and only include them in the model
- Focus on concepts
- Work for Logistic and linear regression
- A process where variable are added and/or removed until the best combination of variables is identified

### Validating Models
- Validate model against an independent datasets



2. Decision Trees




### 2. Compare binary models

### 3. Predict non-binary data
