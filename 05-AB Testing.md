# 05 - A/B Testing

## A/B Testing Fundamentals
- Learn how to set up AB testing and analyze tests
- AB testing is a type of experiment with 2 variants, A and B. Which are the controlled and variation in a controlled experiment
- When you don't have enough data to use modelling techniques.

### 2 Types of Experiments:
- Matched pair design
- Randomized Design

### Experiment Design
- In an experiment, each individual in a test is called a unit.
- A unit can be a person, store, a run on a production line, a view to a website

### Split groups to 2 comparable groups:
#### 1. Treatment Group: the collection of units that will be getting the treatment.
- Treatment = change you are making

#### 2. Control Group
- Baseline comparison for the treatment group.
- No treatment / change is applied

### Variables
- Experimental Variable (aka treatment or independent): Variable you can change to see how it affects the target variable.
- Control Variable (aka predictor): Variables most influential on the outcome of the target variable.
- Target variable: The variable that we are trying to predict the outcome for

#### Control Variable vs Predictor Variables
Predictor: to build equation, to make prediction of a future value.
control: use to make sure that the treatment units and control units are as similar to each other as possible.

### 5 Steps to determine which control variables should be used to set up the experiment
1. List of potential variables
2. Is variable data available?
3. Logical connection between control and target variable
4. Test correlation between control and target Variables
5. Test correlation between control variables

### Lurking Variable (aka confounding variable)
- Highly correlated with both target variable and another control variable
- Cause to overweight a control variable or include the control variable that really isn't important

### Randomized Design
- Technique where the treatment and control units are selected completely randomly
- Used in situation where very little opportunity to control variables, and there the volume and velocity of data is high enough that you're not worries about bias
- Examples: Website-based experiments & Phone system-based Experiments

### Matched Pair Design
- Must be set up ahead of time
- All units must be known before the start of the experiment
- Usually used when the volume of observations or individuals are fairly low
- Concern for bias is great and the cost for observation is high by comparison

### Decide how long to run the test
- At least 1 cycle (e.g. full week)
- Having a full cycle of data reduces the chance of having bias in the responses
- Full cycle is not always possible for the length of an experiment
