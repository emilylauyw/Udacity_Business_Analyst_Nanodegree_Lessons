# 05 - A/B Testing

## A/B Testing Fundamentals
- Learn how to set up AB testing and analyze tests
- AB testing is a type of experiment with 2 variants, A and B. Which are the controlled and variation in a controlled experiment
- When you don't have enough data to use modelling techniques.

### 2 Types of Experiments:
- Matched pair design
- Randomized Design

### Experiment Design
- In an experiment, each individual in a test is called a unit.
- A unit can be a person, store, a run on a production line, a view to a website

### Split groups to 2 comparable groups:
#### 1. Treatment Group: the collection of units that will be getting the treatment.
- Treatment = change you are making

#### 2. Control Group
- Baseline comparison for the treatment group.
- No treatment is applied

### Experimental Variable
- Variable you can change to see how it affects the target variable.

### Control Variable
- Similar to predictor variables in modelling
