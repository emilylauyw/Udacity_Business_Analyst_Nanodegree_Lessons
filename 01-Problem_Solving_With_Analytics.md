# 01 - Problem Solving with Analytics

## The Analytics Problem Solving Framework
Two key analytical concepts to understand any business situation and to choose the correct techniques to analyze the data.

### Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
A data mining process model that describes commonly used approaches that data mining experts use to tackle problems.

CRISP-DM Steps:

1. Business Issue Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Analysis/Modeling
5. Validation
6. Presentation/Visualization

### Predictive Methodology Map
The methodology map is a guide to determine the appropriate analytical technique(s) to solve a particular business question or problem.

The map outlines two main scenarios for a business problem:

1. Data analysis
Data analysis refers to the more standard approaches of blending together data and reporting on trends and statistics and helps answer business questions that involve understanding more about the dataset such as "On average, how many people order coffee and a donut per transaction in my store in any given week?"

2. Predictive analysis
Predictive analysis will help businesses predict future behavior based on existing data such as "Given the average coffee order, how much coffee can I expect to sell next week if I were to add a new brand of coffee?"

## Selecting an Analytical Methodology

## Linear Regression
You will then learn how to create linear regression models to help you predict numerical data such as sales. You'll dive deep into these concepts:

1. Linear relationship
2. Multiple-R squared and p-values
3. Significant coefficients
4. Modeling categorical variables
